# Assigning incident issues to users
{: #assign-incident-issues}

Incident issues that are created by the continuous integration (CI) or continuous compliance (CC) pipelines can have default assignees.
{: shortdesc}

To assign default assignees, set the `incident-assignees` environment property to one or more usernames that are separated by a comma. For example, `First-User` or `First-User,Second-User`. For more information about the `incident-assignees` environment property, see [Pipeline parameters](/docs/devsecops?topic=devsecops-cd-devsecops-pipeline-parm).

The pipeline takes these usernames and assigns these users to the incident issues that are created by the [`collect-evidence`](/docs/devsecops?topic=devsecops-devsecops-collect-evidence) script. If a username is invalid, the logs provide a warning about an unsuccessful assignment, but the evidence collection is successful.

You can define this environment property per trigger so that each trigger can assign different users.
