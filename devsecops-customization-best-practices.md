Provide a set of the most useful links and resources to help adopt DevSecOps architecture.
{: shortdesc}

## About DevSecops toolchains
You discovered and tested IBM Cloud [DevSecOps](https://www.ibm.com/topics/devsecops) Continuous Integration ([CI](/docs/devsecops?topic=devsecops-tutorial-ci-toolchain)), Continuous Deployment ([CD](/docs/devsecops?topic=devsecops-tutorial-cd-toolchain)), Continuous Compliance ([CC](/docs/devsecops?topic=devsecops-tutorial-cc-toolchain)) Toolchains implementing DevSecOps best practices and security tools.

Now, you want to on-board your own application(s), micro-service(s) and adopt DevSecOps.
This page provides you with a set of the most useful information, links and resources to help you on your journey to DevSecOps.

## Rookie

## First experience user
You already tested the DevSecOps samples and want to on-board your own application, micro service.

Review the Basics of DevSecOps customization [page](/docs/devsecops?topic=devsecops-basics-pipelines-customization) to become more familiar with DevSecOps pipeline customization.
## Advanced user
