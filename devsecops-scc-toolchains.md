# Understanding your results after integrating {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} with DevSecOps toolchains
{: #cd-devsecops-scc-toolchains}

With {{site.data.keyword.compliance_full}}, you can automate the evaluation your security and copmliance posture to detect vulnerabilities. By enabling the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} integration through the use of DevSecOps templates, you can store evidence and monitor your deployments for compliance.
{: shortdesc}

Each Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline run that is performed creates evidence. The evidence includes the details of the operations that are performed and is saved in either a Git repository or {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} bucket, known as an evidence locker. By default, a Git repository is used, but if you require the evidence to be more durable - for example, you need a longer lifespan, you can configure a {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} bucket. Similarly, the Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline collects evidence that provides an audit trail of the tasks performed that pertain to acceptance tests, change requests, and more. Most importantly, the Continuous Compliance (CC) pipeline writers an aggregation of all of the individual evidence fragments to an evidence summary when your deployment is complete. When validation tests are run against pipeline data, you can verify that your various best practices are carried out as part of the application deployment process. 


## Before you begin
{: #before-scc-toolchains}

Before you can view the results that are generated by {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}, be sure that you have the following prerequistes.

* The needed level of access to view and interact with the results in {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}. To view results, you must have *Reader* access to the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} service.
* A configured pipeline. For help configuring your pipeline to work with {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}, see [Configuring {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}](/docs/devsecops?topic=devsecops-scc).


## Viewing results 
{: #view-scc-toolchain-results}

To view the results of the compliance evaluation that is completed by {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}, you can visit the [{{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} dashboard](/security-and-compliance-center).

When the DevSecOps pipelines interact with {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}, the information is gathered in two different ways. It is either pushed or pulled by {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} into the dashboard for you to see.


Pull data model
:   When a CI/CD pipeline is run, an [evidence summary](/docs/devsecops?topic=devsecops-devsecops-evidence#cd-devsecops-evidence-summary) is created and named `summary.json`. is forwarded to an evidence locker or a repository. Each entry in the summary is mapped to a control in {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.

   ![CD evidence summary task](images/cd-devsecops-evidence-summary.png){: caption="Figure 1. CD evidence summary task" caption-side="bottom"}

:   Based on the schedule that is set when an attachment is created in {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}, the service pulls the information summary from the locker to perform an evaluation and then presents the results in the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} UI.

   ![Toolchain controls](images/cd-devsecops-toolchain-controls.png){: caption="Figure 2. Toolchain controls" caption-side="bottom"} 

Push data model
:   Each time that a CD/CC pipeline with a valid integration is run, an evidence summary is generated and forwarded to the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} service. The information is evaluated by the service and presented in the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} dashboard.  \n From the dashboard, click the profile that you want to view results for. Then, select the **Resources** tab. From there, click **Additional details** to view more information such as where to find your supporting documentation. For example, you might see links to `pipeline-run evidence summary`, `toolchain`, `pipeline-run`, or `devsec-scc-doc`.

Each piece of information is evaulated against a control and a status is provided. For each control, you are marked as either **Compliant** or **Noncompliant**. For individual resources, the status might be **Pass** or **Fail** depending on whether the evidence fragment met the control qualification. It could also be **Unable to perform**. This status can be returned when an evaluation is attempted but there isn't any corresponding evidence to evaluate; a task might have been removed or skipped in the CI pipeline or a deployment is performed by using the `CD EMERGENCY` to override evidence failures.

Example resource dashboard:

![Validation by resource](images/cd-devsecops-validation-by-resource.png){: caption="Figure 4. Validation by resource" caption-side="bottom"}

While it is possible to deploy an image with imperfect validations, they will be reported on inspection in {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.
