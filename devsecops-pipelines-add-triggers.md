# Adding triggers to pipelines
{: #cd-devsecops-add-pipeline-triggers}

DevSecops continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines provide a set of [default triggers](/docs/devsecops?topic=devsecops-cd-devsecops-triggers). You can add triggers or duplicate existing triggers to pipelines from the Pipeline UI. Refer to **Step 6** of [Configuring a Delivery Pipeline for Tekton by using the console](/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tekton-pipelines&interface=ui#configure_tekton_pipeline)
{: shortdesc}


For more information about Tekton pipeline triggers , see [Working with Tekton pipelines](/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tekton-pipelines).
